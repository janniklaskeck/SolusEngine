# Solus Engine
Simple 3D Engine based on OpenGL, GLFW and ImGui(for the Editor).
Mostly written in C++ with some Python for code generation.

I plan to add some features found in the Unreal Engine and Unity Editors but I work on it only sporadically.

# Features

 - Simple reflection system
 - Simple de-/serialization of "arbitrary" classes
 - Editor window with similar layout to the default Unity Editor layout
 - Crude OpenGL renderer
 - ...
